- subject - subject number
- activity - subject activity
- tBodyAcc-mean()-X - mean of tBodyAcc-mean()-X grouped by subject and activity
- tBodyAcc-mean()-Y - mean of tBodyAcc-mean()-Y  grouped by subject and activity
- tBodyAcc-mean()-Z - mean of tBodyAcc-mean()-Z  grouped by subject and activity
- tBodyAcc-std()-X - mean of tBodyAcc-std()-X  grouped by subject and activity
- tBodyAcc-std()-Y - mean of tBodyAcc-std()-Y  grouped by subject and activity
- tBodyAcc-std()-Z - mean of tBodyAcc-std()-Z  grouped by subject and activity
- tGravityAcc-mean()-X - mean of tGravityAcc-mean()-X  grouped by subject and activity
- tGravityAcc-mean()-Y - mean of tGravityAcc-mean()-Y  grouped by subject and activity
- tGravityAcc-mean()-Z  - mean of tGravityAcc-mean()-Z  grouped by subject and activity
- tGravityAcc-std()-X  - mean of tGravityAcc-std()-X  grouped by subject and activity
- tGravityAcc-std()-Y  - mean of tGravityAcc-std()-Y  grouped by subject and activity
- tGravityAcc-std()-Z - mean of tGravityAcc-std()-Z  grouped by subject and activity
